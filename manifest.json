    "description": "This extension allows the user to open a new tab or a window with the Youtube search of the content inside the search bar, which allows the user to continue watching the current video uninterrupted and open new search results for future browsing and watching. A mouse wheel click or left click + ctrl opens up a new tab. A left click + shift opens up a new window. A left click + ctrl + shift opens up a new tab and switches to it. The current Youtube functionality is that if you left click (or use any of the other combinations on) the search, it either closes the video completely or minimizes it, which might not be the desired behavior for the user. There's no reaction to a regular mouse wheel click on the search button .",
